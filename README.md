Booki, My first project at Openclassrooms

Booki website helps its users to find accommodation and activities in a town of their choosing.

MY task: based on the principles of Material Design, that has been created by the UI designer, I had to deal with the embedding of the design mockups as HTML/CSS mockups.

The site is fully responsive check here: https://mygthbtool.github.io/booki/
